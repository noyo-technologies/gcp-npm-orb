## These parameters are used internally by orb-tools. Skip to the Jobs section.

workflows:
  # Prior to producing a development orb (which requires credentials) basic validation, linting, and even unit testing can be performed.
  # This workflow will run on every commit

    jobs:

      - orb-tools/pack # Pack orb source
